This repo is for experimenting with better ways of displaying backtraces in Rust.

This is part of the [Clean async stack traces](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations/issues/251) initiative in the Rust [Async Foundations Working Group](https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async-foundations/).
